# Welcome to my curriculum vitae!

Hi! I'm Sabrina Guia. I've been working as a front-end developer for the past 3 years.
**Disclaimer**: this is a small project only to explore concepts under the scope of:

- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Context Api](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [Redux Store](https://redux.js.org/api/store) using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- Test-driven Development with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Whats under the hood?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It was developed with the following versions:
```  
$ node --version
v16.11.1  
```
```  
$ yarn --version
1.13.0
```
This app is interacting with this [Python API](https://github.com/NickVrgr/LinkedinAPI).
Both are running on the same [nginx server](https://www.nginx.com/). 
The deployment of the app can be accessed at [sabrinaguia.pt](https://sabrinaguia.pt/). 

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `install the project dependencies`
```  
$ yarn 
```

#### `run the app in development mode`
```  
$ yarn start
``` 
The view will be loaded at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and will reload if you make source code changes.

#### `run all unit tests`
```  
$ yarn test
```

#### `run all unit tests in the interactive watch mode`
```  
$ yarn test:coverage
```

#### `build the project`
```  
$ yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
